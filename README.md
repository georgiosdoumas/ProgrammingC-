# ProgrammingC-
In this directory I will put exercises that I solve from programming books on C that are general
and not linux specific (the linux specific will go to the other folder with title "LinuxProgramming")
A folder with the name of the book , and subfolders of chapters of the book will contain source files .c
A simple MyNotes file will contain Errata or other things that I find interesting.
